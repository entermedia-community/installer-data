What changes climate?
• Changes in:
– Sun’s output
– Earth’s orbit
– Drifting continents
– Volcanic eruptions
– Greenhouse gases
“Greenhouse effect” Increasing greenhouse gas s trap more hea
Greenhouse gases
Nitrous oxide
Water
Carbon dioxide
Methane
Sulfur hexafluoride

Could the warming be natural?
Is it real?
Effects: Snow and ice
Grinnell Glacier, Glacier National Park
1900 and 2008
Effects on precipitation
Effects on ecosystems
How do we know?
Present day observations
Computer models 
Aspen, CO Forecast:
Partly cloudy today
High :  28°F
Low:  13°F
Increasing clouds 
over night. Colder 
tomorrow.

Why should we care?
2003 European Heat Wave
Germany: Lowest river levels 
this century
Switzerland: Melting 
glaciers, avalanches
France: >14,000 
deaths
Portugal: Forest fires
U.K.: Train rails buckle
Sea-level rise  projections : a few inches to a few feet
•2 ft: U.S. would lose 10,000 square miles
•3 ft: Would inundate Miami
•Affects erosion, loss of wetlands, freshwater supplies
•Half of the world’s population lives along coasts
•Big question:  Ice sheets

How sure are scientists?
What don’t we know?
• Is there some critical piece of the about climate process we don’t 
understand?
• How and when  will our fossil fuel use change?
• Will future , yet-to-be-discovered technologies  mitigate the problem?
• How will changing economics, global population, and political processes 
affect our ability to tackle the problem?
The IPCC
2007 Conclusions
• Warming of the climate system is unequivocal
• Very high confidence that global average net effect of 
human activities since 1750 one of warming 
• Human-caused warming over last 30 years has likely  had 
a visible influence on many physical and biological 
systems 
• Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates 
would cause further warming and induce many changes 
in the global climate system during the 21st century that 
would very likely be larger than those observed during 
the 20th century.”
Consensus?
• Do we know enough about the 
drivers of climate to know what 
causes change? 
• Are we underestimating the Earth 
system’s complexity ?
• Can models accurately simulate 
the complex climate system? 
•Are there processes that will limit 
warming naturally?
On the other hand…
• Arctic sea ice melting faster than predicted.
• Fossil fuel emissions exceeded most IPCC 
projections.
• Are assumptions about global energy use are 
too optimistic?
•How quickly can developing countries reduce 
GHG emissions?
• Calculations don’t include unexpected melting 
in Greenland and Antarctica.
What do climate scientists really think?
Be an educated consumer 
• IPCC AR4 Synthesis Report (
http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-syr.htm)
• Other organizations: 
–NAS (http://dels.nas.edu/climatechange/)
–US CCSP (http://www.climatescience.gov/)
• Look for contrasting opinions
• Evaluate the source
   What next—what can we do?
  What next—what can we do?
Produce more fuel-efficient vehicles
Reduce vehicle use
Improve energy-efficiency in buildings
Develop carbon capture and storage processes
Triple nuclear power
Increase solar power
Decrease deforestation/plant forests
Improve soil carbon management strategies 
Individual actions 
Use mass 
transit, bike, 
walk, roller 
skate
Tune up 
your 
furnace
Unplug 
appliances or 
plug into a 
power strip and 
switch it off
Buy water-saving 
appliances and 
toilets;  installing 
low-flow shower 
heads.
Caulk, 
weatherstrip, 
insulate, and 
replace old 
windows
Buy products 
with a U.S. EPA 
Energy Star 
label
